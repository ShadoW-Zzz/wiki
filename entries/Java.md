Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence and versatility. It was created by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, allowing Java programs to run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
